## Common Weakness Enumeration
CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Base Score: 7.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details

During the installation of the `getscreen.msi` file, a directory is created in the user's `%TEMP` folder where two files `getscreen.exe` and `getscreen-x86.exe` are dropped. 
If an attacker replaces either of these files with a malicious binary of the same name, it could lead to a potential elevation of privilege. 
This vulnerability arises because `msiexec.exe` performs several file operations with SYSTEM-level integrity on these files within the low-privileged user's `%TEMP%` folder.
